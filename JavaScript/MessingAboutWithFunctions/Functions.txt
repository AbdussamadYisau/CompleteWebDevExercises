Functions are blocks of code which perform one or more specific tasks.

There are a couple of in-built functions that we already use a lot, eg
alert() , prompt(), clear () etc


The brackets, () mean that the functions are being called.

alert("Hi there!") -> Hi there is an argument. Arguments are what are passed into the function.

NB: Functions must be called before it can be used.

Two ways of creating a function: 
1) function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hellooo");
}

sayHello()

2) Function Expression. This function does not have a name, it is called an anonymous function.

var sayBye = function() {
  console.log("Bye")
}

sayBye()
   
function multiply(a,b) {
 return("This is to multiply " + a + " and " + b + " ,which gives us: " + (a*b));

}
  multiply(5,6);
// It works actually

 - parameters vs arguments:
So, parameters are the template inputs specified when calling a function. Whereas, arguments are the inputs passed into a function.

There's a thin line there, and I hope you find it. 


function checkDriverAge() {
  var age = prompt("What is your age?");

  if (Number(age) < 18) {
    alert("Sorry, you are too yound to drive this car. Powering off");
  } else if (Number(age) > 18) {
    alert("Powering On. Enjoy the ride!");
  } else if (Number(age) === 18) {
    alert("Congratulations on your first year of driving. Enjoy the ride!");
  }
}
