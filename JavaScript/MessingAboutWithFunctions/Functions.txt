Functions are blocks of code which perform one or more specific tasks.

There are a couple of in-built functions that we already use a lot, eg
alert() , prompt(), clear () etc


The brackets, () mean that the functions are being called.

alert("Hi there!") -> Hi there is an argument. Arguments are what are passed into the function.

NB: Functions must be called before it can be used.

function multiply(a,b) {
 return("This is to multiply " + a + " and " + b + " ,which gives us: " + (a*b));

}
  multiply(5,6);
// It works actually

 - parameters vs arguments:
So, parameters are the template inputs specified when qeiting a function. Whereas, arguments are the inputs passed into a function.

There's a thin line there, and I hope you find it.
