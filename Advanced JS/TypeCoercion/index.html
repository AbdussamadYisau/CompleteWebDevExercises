<!-- Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another (such as strings to numbers). Type conversion is similar to type coercion because they both convert values from one data type to another with one key difference â€” type coercion is implicit whereas type conversion can be either implicit or explicit. -->

<!--Although all programming languages have type coercion, JavaScript's is especially heavy due to the fact that the language is dynamically typed. -->

<!-- Difference between == and ===; for the former,one of the variables should be coerced to the other and then check for comparison. in the latter, no variables should be coerced, just check for equality -->
